</div>The '''Russian Orbital Segment''' ('''ROS''') is the name given to the components of the [[wikipedia:International Space Station]] (ISS) constructed in [[wikipedia:Russia]] and operated by the [[wikipedia:Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos). The ROS handles Guidance, Navigation & Control for the entire Station.

==Current composition==
The segment currently consists of five modules, which together essentially comprise the base configuration of the canceled Russian space station [[wikipedia:Mir-2|''Mir''-2]]. The segment is controlled directly from Roskosmos's [[wikipedia:RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] in [[wikipedia:Moscow|Moscow]].
