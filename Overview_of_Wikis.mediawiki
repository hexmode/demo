==Overview of wikis and MediaWiki==
<b>
<p>
The creation of the first wiki is credited to Ward Cunningham in 1995. He created the "WikiWikiWeb," and ran it off of his website with software of the same name. Later on the term also referred to user-editable websites and applications used to run such websites, no matter who had created them

In 2000, Jimmy Wales dreamt up Nupedia, edited by Larry Sanger who eventually pushed Wales to call it "Wikipedia". Sanger later left due to philosophical conflicts, and became one of the biggest critics of Wikipedia.
